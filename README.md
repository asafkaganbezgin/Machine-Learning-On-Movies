Polynomial Regression Performance
===
The aim of the project is to create and apply polynomial regression model on a movie dataset and calculate its performance based on its *mean squared error, mean squared log error and r2 score.* Different models could be applied to the same dataset and make a comparison. The model predicts the revenue of the movies based on their *budget, popularity and runtime*. Feel free to play with the regression degree in the code to see the difference in results.

The dataset used is taken from **Kaggle**. You can take a look from the link below:

> https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv

The data is preprocessed by a friend of mine. Therefore, you need to put additional work to simplify the dataset obtained from the site if you would like to use it. However, there is a dataset folder in the project where you can see the preprocessed data which my model depends on. You can keep using it if you wish (additional processing is made in the code).

I didn't use a notebook to develop and test my model. The project is developed, tested and runned locally. In order to run the project, you have to install necessary libraries via **pip** so that you won't get a warning from your python compiler and be able to run the code in your local machine. Copying the code into a jupiter notebook might also be a solution to run the code.
